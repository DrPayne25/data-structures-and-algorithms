## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Worked with Victor to get this done we started with our problem domain and followed from there. We did a bit of sudo code once we were done with question and visual. Then dived a bit into different ways of doing this after looking over google. Big 0 time is still o as well as space.

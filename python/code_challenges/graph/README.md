# Graphs

## Challenge

In today's code challenge we had to implement our own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list.

## Approach & Efficiency

This one was rough for me having no psudeo code really threw me off wanna try and rebuild this without looking at the docs I needed to next time

The Big(O):
    time: O(1)
    space: O(n)
